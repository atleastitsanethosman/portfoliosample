  # Description
  
This project was meant to build a professional portfolio using react that could be shown to a potential employer so that they can view some examples of the work I am capable of.  The goal being to set up a professional looking webpage with links to sample projects that will allow me to add images and links as I deploy more applications and can continue to add examples to show to a potential employer.  Styled with colors that match well with Michigan State University's school colors as I am attending the Michigan State University Coding Bootcamp.
The application includes a contact form that sends an email message to me using emailJS and the ability to download my resume.
