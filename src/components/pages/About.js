          I am currently enrolled as a student in the Michigan State University Coding Bootcamp, learning the skills necessary to be a full stack web developer. 
          I graduated from Michigan State University with a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Supply Chain Management, and after a 16 year career in positions of increasing 
          responsibility at manufacturing companies in various industries, I have decided to take the steps necessary to make a shift in my career.
